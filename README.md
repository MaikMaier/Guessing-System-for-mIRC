# mSL-mIRC-Guessing-Script

This repository contains a mIRC Chatbot for Twitch-Streamers. 
It may contain many errors, because it's pretty new. 
The two seperate remote scripts are "Linkblocker.txt" and "Script Vxxxx". Other files are documentation.
If you have any guestions contact me at mircGuessScript (at) maikmaier.de
