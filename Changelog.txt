New functions:
- Implemented a very basic !commands
- Implementet !pointsof <username> to get the points of a specific user


V0.1.3 - 10.05.15
Errors fixed:
- You can no longer use !result more than once. It did not check whether there is a active game
New functions:
- Implemented new guessing-goals. Either XPM GPM Kills or Death are now choosen by random. XPM and GPM allow guessers to be 50 points off.


V0.1.2 - 06.05.15
Errors fixed:
- Previous solution to: Userentries with only 0 Points and no used bounties were not deleted from the Points.ini file. did not work.
  Fixed it by correcting the Event to "part" which is the counterpart to "join".
  You dont need to mind that anymore: This solution will ONLY!! work if the bot is'nt active in more than one channel.
  This solution will always work.
- Fixed a bug, where a winner recieved no points for winning if he left the channel with 0 points and no redeems before the game ended.


V0.1.1 - 04.05.15
Errors fixed:
- Users were able to use !herorequest despite having too few points
- !hrdone did not work properly, because of a wrong condition
- Timers activated even tho a game got aborted by using !result <x>
- Userentries with only 0 Points and no used bounties were not deleted from the Points.ini file.
  Important note: This solution will ONLY!! work if the bot is'nt active in more than one channel. If the bot and user share more than 1 channel,
  the removal of Points.ini entries will not work properly.
New functions:
- Implemented !abort to stop the current guessing round
  This command will work while a game is running. (Time between !start and !result)
- Implemented !restart to reset the timer and delete all guesses
  This command will only work while users are allowed to guess
