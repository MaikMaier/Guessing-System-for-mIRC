--------------------------------------- Changelog of VITALIC_DOTA2s Twitch Channel Chatbot ----------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V0.1.1 - 04.05.15

Errors fixed:
- Users were able to use !herorequest despite having too few points
- !hrdone did not work properly, because of a wrong condition
- Timers activated even tho a game got aborted by using !result <x>
- Userentries with only 0 Points and no used bounties were not deleted from the Points.ini file.
  Important note: This solution will ONLY!! work if the bot is'nt active in more than one channel. If the bot and user share more than 1 channel,
  the removal of Points.ini entries will not work properly.

New functions:
- Implemented !abort to stop the current guessing round
  This command will work while a game is running. (Time between !start and !result)
 
- Implemented !restart to reset the timer and delete all guesses
  This command will only work while users are allowed to guess
